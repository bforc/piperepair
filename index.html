<p data-start="104" data-end="754">When it comes to maintaining the integrity of a building, few systems are as vital - yet often overlooked, as the plumbing and drainage. In particular, vertical pipes known as <strong data-start="281" data-end="295">downspouts</strong> (or <em data-start="300" data-end="310">bajantes</em> in Spanish) are essential for transporting waste and rainwater away from a structure. Over time, however, these pipes can deteriorate due to wear, corrosion, blockages, or shifts in structure. Traditional repair methods involve major construction work, often requiring wall demolition and lengthy disruptions. That-s where <strong data-start="634" data-end="644">Entuba</strong> comes in, a Spanish company revolutionizing the field with their <a href="https://www.entuba.es/servicios/rehabilitacion-de-bajantes/">Bajantes sin obras</a> services.</p>
<p data-start="756" data-end="954">Here-s everything you should know about <strong data-start="796" data-end="832">Entuba-s downspout repair system</strong>, how it works, and why it's gaining popularity among homeowners, property managers, and construction professionals alike.</p>

<h3 data-start="1513" data-end="1551">Why Traditional Repairs Fall Short</h3>
<p data-start="1553" data-end="1938">In older buildings, especially those constructed before modern PVC piping became standard, downspouts often consist of iron, lead, or ceramic materials. These are prone to corrosion, cracking, or leaking over time. Traditionally, fixing these issues meant breaking into walls or ceilings, replacing the pipes manually, then rebuilding and restoring the affected areas. This process is:</p>

<p data-start="1942" data-end="1958">Time-consuming</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="1959" data-end="1972">
<p data-start="1961" data-end="1972">Expensive</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="1973" data-end="1992">
<p data-start="1975" data-end="1992">Noisy and messy</p>
</li>

<p data-start="2041" data-end="2109">With Entuba-s approach, these inconveniences are avoided altogether.</p>

<h3 data-start="2116" data-end="2170">How Entuba Repairs Downspouts Without Construction</h3>
<p data-start="2172" data-end="2353">Entuba uses a method based on <strong data-start="2202" data-end="2239">Cured-In-Place Pipe (CIPP) lining</strong>, a trenchless technology originally developed for large sewer systems. Here-s how the process works step-by-step:</p>

<ol data-start="2355" data-end="3220">
 	<li data-start="2355" data-end="2546">
<p data-start="2358" data-end="2546"><strong data-start="2358" data-end="2372">Inspection</strong><br data-start="2372" data-end="2375" />Using state-of-the-art video cameras, Entuba inspects the inside of the downspouts to assess the extent of damage and locate issues like cracks, leaks, or obstructions.</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="2548" data-end="2730">
<p data-start="2551" data-end="2730"><strong data-start="2551" data-end="2563">Cleaning</strong><br data-start="2563" data-end="2566" />The pipe is thoroughly cleaned with high-pressure water or mechanical tools to remove any grease, scale, or buildup that could interfere with the lining process.</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="2732" data-end="2915">
<p data-start="2735" data-end="2915"><strong data-start="2735" data-end="2757">Liner Installation</strong><br data-start="2757" data-end="2760" />A flexible resin-impregnated liner is inserted into the pipe using compressed air or water. This liner molds to the internal shape of the existing pipe.</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="2917" data-end="3072">
<p data-start="2920" data-end="3072"><strong data-start="2920" data-end="2930">Curing</strong><br data-start="2930" data-end="2933" />The liner is hardened in place using hot water, steam, or UV light, creating a solid, seamless, and durable new pipe within the old one.</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="3074" data-end="3220">
<p data-start="3077" data-end="3220"><strong data-start="3077" data-end="3097">Final Inspection</strong><br data-start="3097" data-end="3100" />After curing, Entuba conducts a second camera inspection to ensure the pipe is fully sealed and functioning properly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-start="3222" data-end="3344">This method reinforces the structural integrity of the existing pipe while preventing leaks, root intrusion, or corrosion.</p>
